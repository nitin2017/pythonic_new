# tuple data structure
# tuple can store any data type
# tuples are immutable 
# data inside tuple
# tuples are faster , better than list 

example = ("one","two","three")
# no append , no insert , no pop , no remove 

# we generally use tuple when we know data is going to be static and do not change for e.g 
days = ('monday','tuesday')

## methods in tuple 
# count , index , len , slicing
